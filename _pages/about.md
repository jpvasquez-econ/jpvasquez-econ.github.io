<img class="img-responsive" style="float: left; margin: 0px 20px 20px 0px;" src="/images/profile.jpg" width="320"> I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at UC Berkeley, expecting to graduate in May 2020. My main fields of research are Labor Economics and International Trade. I am also interested in Development Economics and Economic Geography.

During the 2020-2021 academic year, I will be a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Griswold Center for Economic Policy Studies and the Department of Economics at Princeton University. Starting in 2021, I will become an Assistant Professor at the Department of Management of the London School of Economics.
